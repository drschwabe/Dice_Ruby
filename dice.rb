This is a practice Ruby script.  To simulate... a DICE. 
What can a dice do?  Well. It can roll. 
What properties are of it?  It has 6 sides (typically, though some DnD ones have more)
What happens when dice rolled?  It lands!  One one of the six sides.
The dice then shows the result.  And the roll is complete.  
So we have a begin state (let's assume begin state is in your hand).
A rolling state.  Rolls typically take a few seconds. 
And the final result state.  In which the roll is complete, and the result is displayed for us all to see.
